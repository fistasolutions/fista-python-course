# 🚀 Lesson: Variables in Python  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives (OBE)  
By the end of this lesson, you will:  
✅ Understand what **variables** are and why they are important.  
✅ Learn how to **create and use variables** in Python.  
✅ Develop a **real-world mini-project** using variables.  
✅ Strengthen your understanding with **clear explanations and analogies**.

## 🏗 Project for This Topic (PBL)  
📌 **Project:** Create a Simple Expense Tracker  
🛠 **What we will build:** A basic program that stores and displays expenses using variables.  
📌 **Why?** Variables help us store and manipulate data dynamically.  
🔥 **Skills Gained:**  
- Declaring and using variables  
- Performing arithmetic operations  
- Understanding data types  

📷 **Suggested Image for Project:** *A notepad with expenses listed as variables (e.g., "Food = 500, Transport = 300").*

## 🔍 Understanding Variables with Simple Examples  

### 🧐 What are Variables?  
Imagine a **labeled storage box** 📦 where you store different items.  
In Python, a **variable** is like that box—it holds a value that we can use later.  

📷 **Suggested Image for Explanation:** *A shelf with labeled boxes representing different variables like `name`, `age`, and `salary`.*

### 🔢 Key Concepts of Variables  

📌 **Creating a Variable**  
A variable is created by assigning a value using `=`.  

```python
name = "Alice"  # Storing a string
age = 12        # Storing a number
height = 4.9    # Storing a decimal number
```

📌 **Changing Variable Values**  
You can update variables anytime!  

```python
score = 10
score = score + 5  # Now score is 15
print(score)
```

📌 **Multiple Variable Assignments**  
You can assign multiple variables in one line.  

```python
a, b, c = 5, 10, 15
print(a, b, c)
```

📌 **Using Variables in Calculations**  

```python
price = 100
tax = 0.08 * price  # 8% tax
total = price + tax
print("Total price:", total)
```

📷 **Suggested Image for Concepts:** *A shopping receipt with total calculated using variables.*

## 🚀 Project Implementation (Hands-on Practice)  

### 🎯 **Building a Simple Expense Tracker**  
Let's create a program that stores and calculates daily expenses.  

```python
food = 500
transport = 300
entertainment = 200

total_expense = food + transport + entertainment
print("Today's Total Expense:", total_expense)
```

📷 **Suggested Image for Project Steps:** *A budget chart showing expenses broken into categories (food, transport, etc.).*  

💡 **Try modifying the program** to add more categories or take user input for expenses!

## ✅ Summary of Variables  
✔ Variables store values like numbers, text, or decimals.  
✔ You can update and use variables in calculations.  
✔ Variables make programs dynamic and reusable.  

### 🎯 **Mini-Challenge:**  
Modify the expense tracker to include `savings` and subtract it from the total.
